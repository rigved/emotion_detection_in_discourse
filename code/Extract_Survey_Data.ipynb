I'm looking for answers and views of some events that I'm going to string together and ask you to discuss as far as you can in an appropriate manner. Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police shot and killed Alton Sterling. Video shows that he was shot while being pinned to the ground by two officers. Outside of Minneapolis, police shot and killed Philando Castile at what should have been a routine traffic stop. He was armed, but reports suggest that he repeatedly told police that he had a valid permit for the weapon. In Dallas, a gunman killed five police officers and wounded seven others in what appeared to be a well-planned attack--this terrible act in the middle of an otherwise peaceful protest in a city that has become a model for community-engaged policing. And so I think you're qualified to advise us here, as both the chief law enforcement officer in the United States and the first African-American woman to hold that post. How can we make sense of these events during these trying times, ma'am?</td>\n",

And it is my hope that, as we all look at these tragic incidents, that we will take the opportunity to draw closer to each other, to have the difficult conversations about race and policing in this country, involving all sides, involving all issues and all points of view. I have spent the last year as Attorney General touring this great country, meeting specifically on the issue of police and community relations. And I have sought out jurisdictions that have had extremely troubled relationships but have, in fact, made the conscious decision to pull themselves back from that brink and develop a positive relationship between the community and law enforcement. It can be done. I have seen it done. You have cited Dallas as one example of a police department that, through its community policing efforts, has crafted a strong bond with its community so that, when there is tension, there is an outlet, there is a way for discussion. I believe, Congressman, that the key to many of the problems that we face is communication--communication and truly listening to one another, listening to individuals who feel for whatever reason separated and at a distance from the goals of this great country, individuals who feel that they do not have an opportunity to fully participate in this great democracy; as well as listening to our brave members of law enforcement, who talk to me every day with great poignancy about why they joined this wonderful profession, their desire to protect, to serve, to put young people on the right path, to build a better country, and to, in fact, build strong communities because they live in those communities. All of that must be recognized, as well as the pain of law enforcement, who feel themselves under attack as well. By recognizing our common humanity, our common loss, and our common goals, we can, in fact, work on this difficult problem.</td>\n",

       "56  Thank you. Thank you for being here again, Attorney General, and thank you very much for your frank and candid discussion with us that is now taking place. I'm looking for answers and views of some events that I'm going to string together and ask you to discuss as far as you can in an appropriate manner. Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police shot and killed Alton Sterling. Video shows that he was shot while being pinned to the ground by two officers. Outside of Minneapolis, police shot and killed Philando Castile at what should have been a routine traffic stop. He was armed, but reports suggest that he repeatedly told police that he had a valid permit for the weapon. In Dallas, a gunman killed five police officers and wounded seven others in what appeared to be a well-planned attack--this terrible act in the middle of an otherwise peaceful protest in a city that has become a model for community-engaged policing. And so I think you're qualified to advise us here, as both the chief law enforcement officer in the United States and the first African-American woman to hold that post. How can we make sense of these events during these trying times, ma'am?   \n",

Thank you. Let me go to a different subject, and this is back to the FBI investigation, though. The usual practice in such an investigation is to leave the decision on whether or not to recommend prosecution to the Attorney General. Did you suggest to Director Comey, directly or indirectly, that he make the decision rather than you?   \n",

To answer further would require a discussion of the facts and the analysis of this matter, which, as I've indicated, I'm not in a position to provide at the time. Again, I refer you to Director Comey's discussion for that. As I've indicated, the team reviewed this matter, and it was a unanimous team decision.   \n",

       "56  Thank you, Congressman, for the opportunity to speak on these issues. I believe that you have truly outlined the issue of the day facing our Nation. And it is my hope that, as we all look at these tragic incidents, that we will take the opportunity to draw closer to each other, to have the difficult conversations about race and policing in this country, involving all sides, involving all issues and all points of view. I have spent the last year as Attorney General touring this great country, meeting specifically on the issue of police and community relations. And I have sought out jurisdictions that have had extremely troubled relationships but have, in fact, made the conscious decision to pull themselves back from that brink and develop a positive relationship between the community and law enforcement. It can be done. I have seen it done. You have cited Dallas as one example of a police department that, through its community policing efforts, has crafted a strong bond with its community so that, when there is tension, there is an outlet, there is a way for discussion. I believe, Congressman, that the key to many of the problems that we face is communication--communication and truly listening to one another, listening to individuals who feel for whatever reason separated and at a distance from the goals of this great country, individuals who feel that they do not have an opportunity to fully participate in this great democracy; as well as listening to our brave members of law enforcement, who talk to me every day with great poignancy about why they joined this wonderful profession, their desire to protect, to serve, to put young people on the right path, to build a better country, and to, in fact, build strong communities because they live in those communities. All of that must be recognized, as well as the pain of law enforcement, who feel themselves under attack as well. By recognizing our common humanity, our common loss, and our common goals, we can, in fact, work on this difficult problem.   \n",

I just don't recall him speaking directly to that. And, at this point, again, I think that, with respect to what was reviewed in the investigation about the handling of the emails, we heard the basis of his recommendation, and, in fact, the team came to a similar conclusion.   \n",
